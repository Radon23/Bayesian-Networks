Topic: Comparison of Bayesian Networks implementation in
Figaro and Python, comparing through parameters like
performance, efficiency and code reliability.
Bayesian Networks have traditionally been implemented in
languages like Python, but the emergence of an Object
Oriented Probabilistic Programming language might be here to
change that, Figaro.
We will try to implement a Bayesian Network in Figaro and try
to compare it with existing implementations of BN in Python.
This might give us an insight of what things are possible in
Figaro and the areas it can replace Python in fields like
Machine Learning. We hope to learn a lot with this.
Performance Metrics:
- Time of execution
- Memory for execution
- Code reliability for programmers
- Length of program
  
We hope that this project helps us understand Figaro at
a deeper level and give us new insights.

# Tasks Completed: 

We were focused on studying causal effects for diseases to gauge the use of Principles of Programming Languages in the medical field.

We implemented 2 Bayesian Networks, both in Python and Figaro and compared them on various parameters, the detailed report is present in 
results folder, the resesarch paper used for cancer risk prediction is given in the tests folder and all the code is given in the code-orig folder.


# Work Split:

Pratyush was dedicated in understanding the traditional methods of Bayesian Networks implementations and techniques such as Variable Elimination (expertise in this due to ML Course).
Jatin was dedicated in studying how these techniques are already implemented in Figaro and what helps make the traditional Python code shorter and faster in Figaro.

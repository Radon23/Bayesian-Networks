Topic: Comparison of Bayesian Networks implementation in
Figaro and Python, comparing through parameters like
performance, efficiency and code reliability.
Bayesian Networks have traditionally been implemented in
languages like Python, but the emergence of an Object
Oriented Probabilistic Programming language might be here to
change that, Figaro.
We will try to implement a Bayesian Network in Figaro and try
to compare it with existing implementations of BN in Python.
This might give us an insight of what things are possible in
Figaro and the areas it can replace Python in fields like
Machine Learning. We hope to learn a lot with this.
Performance Metrics:
- Time of execution
- Memory for execution
- Code reliability for programmers
- Length of program
We hope that this project helps us understand Figaro at
a deeper level and give us new insights.
